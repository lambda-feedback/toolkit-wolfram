### Publishing

For building and publishing the Paclet, the [`build-paclet`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-paclet) GitHub action is used.

This action uses the [`Wolfram/PacletCICD`](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PacletRepository/resources/Wolfram/PacletCICD/version/0.36.0/) utilities to build and publish the Paclet.

Please refer to the documentation of the action and the utilities for more information.
